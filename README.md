residual sugar
chlorides
free sulfur dioxide
total sulfur dioxide
density
pH
sulphates
alcohol
* Output variable: quality (score between 0 and 10)
* Dataset characteristics: Multivariate
* Number of observation: 1599
* Number of attribute / variables: 12
* Missing value: N/A

# Conclusion
By using data visualization and prediction modelling, we can observed the key factors that determine and affects the quality of the red wine. Wine quality is ultimately a subjective measure. To make predictions of wine quality and any other if required, we trained four models. As we can see the result that the Random Forest Classifier performed gave the best predictive. The Random Forest Classifier performed marginally better than other models. The usage of this analysis will help to understand whether by modifying the variables, it is possible to increase the quality of the wine on the market. If you can control your variables, then you can predict the quality of your wine and obtain more profits.
